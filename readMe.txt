Our program assumptions:
-The Client:
-When the client logs in he has two options depending on whether he had already reserved a table or not;
-if he hadn't reserved a table,he will choose his number of seats and type of table(smoking /non-smoking)
-if he had already reserved a table and wants to add to his previously ordered dishes he would be able to by pressing the "add dishes button".
-if he had already reserved a table he could also press the" reservation button "to change his table requirements.
-In the menu,the client should firstly click the"click here to add dishes" to choose his dishes and their quantities.when he is done he clicks the "checkout" button to view his total amount of money and choose his payment method.
-If he chooses payment method"visa",he enters the visa card number.

-The Manager:
-When the manager logs in ,he has 3 options;
-He can view today's reservations;the client name,the table number,the dishes ordered by each table,the money paid by each client.
-He can view today's total money earned by the restaurant
-He can add users.

-The Cook:
-When the cook logs in he is able to view dishes ordered today and the table number ordering it.

-the Waiter:
-When the waiter logs in he is able to view the clients' names reserving tables today and their table numbers.

labour division:
We designed the general idea of the program together.We also thought about the classes relations together and just started by sketching some of the classes and their attributes and methods.Mariam was generally responsible for coding ,and Aisha was responsible for the class diagram and design.However, we worked on the logic of the whole program together.GUI was also shared between us.

-In our project we created our own additional classes (e.g MyUsers,MyTables...etc),besides the classes from the xml file...
we mainly used the classes we created in our program to show inheritance and OOP concepts...

-We added images in source file in the project, they appear normally in the project run on the IDE however they do not appear in the jar file (only png images do not appear).
